    Use this skill to convert raw client input (email, WhatsApp, verbal, or a Linear issue URL) into a properly structured Linear issue in Specs style. Provide the raw text or a Linear issue URL and this skill will draft a developer-ready ticket with IST/SOLL structure, acceptance criteria, and QA steps.

# Linear Intake Skill — {{CLIENT_NAME}} ({{OUTPUT_TEAM}})

Converts raw {{INPUT_LANGUAGE}} client input (WhatsApp, email, verbal, or a Linear issue URL) into a properly structured Linear issue in {{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}} for the **{{CLIENT_NAME}}** development team.

## Fixed context

- **Source team**: `{{INPUT_TEAM}}`
- **Destination team**: `{{OUTPUT_TEAM}}`
- **Language**: {{PRESERVED_TERMS_NOTE}}
- **Audience**: the developer reading the ticket should be able to start immediately

---

## Specs rules

### General rules
- Short and dense. No fluff, no preamble.
- Markdown. Use `code` for field/table/column/UI names. Use **bold** for key constraints.

### Feature request → IST/SOLL (small) or Current/Want (larger)

**Small change — IST/SOLL:**
```
IST:
- [what exists now]

SOLL:
- [what should happen]

[1-2 sentences of context only if non-obvious]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [specific, testable condition]

## QA
- [how to verify the result — steps a tester should follow]
- [edge cases to check]
```

**Larger feature — structured sections:**
```
## Current situation
- [what exists now]
- [relevant context]

## What we want
- [desired behavior]
- [scope or constraints]
  - sub-detail if needed

## Why / context
[1-2 sentences, skip if obvious]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [specific, testable condition]

## QA
- [how to verify the result — steps a tester should follow]
- [edge cases to check]
```

### Bug report
```
[One-line summary of what's wrong]

Steps / context:
- [where to look or how to reproduce]
- [what happens]
- [what should happen instead]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [condition that confirms the bug is fixed]

## QA
- [how to verify the fix]
- [regression checks if relevant]

## Screenshots
[attach any relevant screenshots here]
```

### Operational task (content, newsletter, images)
```
[Short imperative title: "Prepare April newsletter for sending"]

Deliverables:
- [list attachments/content/actions]
- Deadline: [if mentioned]
```
*Operational tasks don't need acceptance criteria or QA sections.*

### Title format
- Verb-first, concise: `Add payment deadline to order confirmation email`
- Bugs: `Fix [thing] in [location]` or `[Thing] not working in [location]`
- No user story format ("Als gebruiker wil ik...")
- No ticket numbers in the title

### Priority
{{PRIORITY_TABLE}}

---

## Cross-team rules

These rules always apply, regardless of the source:

- **Never** edit or add a comment to the source issue
- **Always** add a `related to` relation in both the source issue and the new issue
- **Never** refer to the source issue in the text — do not mention it in the title, description, or body (including references like "see original ticket", "as mentioned in the source issue", or "screenshot from original")
- **Never** mention the source team code (`{{INPUT_TEAM}}`) in the title or description of the new issue
- **Always** copy screenshots from the source into a `## Screenshots` section at the bottom of the new issue
- **When unclear which project to pick**: ask the user and list all available project options

---

## Projects

Always assign to one of these {{OUTPUT_TEAM}} projects:

{{PROJECTS_TABLE}}

**Selection logic:**
{{SELECTION_LOGIC}}

---

## Workflow

1. **Identify the input:**
   - Raw text (WhatsApp, email, verbal) → proceed directly
   - Linear issue URL → fetch the issue content from team `{{INPUT_TEAM}}`; treat its content as raw input
2. **One or multiple issues?** Always create NEW issue(s) in team `{{OUTPUT_TEAM}}`. If the input covers multiple distinct topics or work areas, split into separate tickets.
3. Classify each issue: **feature**, **bug**, or **operational task**.
4. Draft the **title** ({{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}, verb-first).
5. Draft the **description** using the correct format above — including acceptance criteria and QA sections for features and bugs.
6. Infer **priority** from language signals.
7. Select the **project** (default: {{DEFAULT_PROJECT}}).
8. Create the new issue(s) in Linear under team `{{OUTPUT_TEAM}}` with the correct project.
9. Reply with all new issue URL(s).
10. Learn from this process and propose improvements to this skill if you spot them.

> **Always create NEW issues in `{{OUTPUT_TEAM}}`.** Never edit or comment on the source issue.

---

## Notes
- Never add Specs internal commentary to the Linear description.
- When input is ambiguous, pick the most likely interpretation and draft — don't over-ask.
- Default priority when uncertain: Normal (3).
- Default project when uncertain: {{DEFAULT_PROJECT}}.
