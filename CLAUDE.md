# agent-specs

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. Each plugin under `plugins/<name>/`
bundles some combination of skills, commands, MCP servers, hooks, and agents.

## Keep plugin READMEs in sync

Every plugin's `README.md` must accurately list all the elements the plugin
currently contains — skills, commands, MCP servers, hooks, agents, or anything
else it ships. Whenever you add, remove, or rename any of these inside a
plugin (e.g. a new skill directory under `plugins/<name>/skills/`, a new
command under `plugins/<name>/commands/`, a hook, an MCP server, an agent),
update that plugin's `README.md` in the same change so it never drifts from
what's actually in the plugin directory.

## Keep the root README in sync

The root `README.md` plugins table must list every plugin declared in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Whenever a plugin is added, removed, or
renamed in the marketplace manifest, update the root `README.md` table to
match.

## Keep plugin descriptions in sync

Each plugin declares its `description` in two places: its own
`plugin.json` (or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) and its entry in the root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. The CLI reads the description from
`marketplace.json`, so both must always carry the same text. Whenever you
change a plugin's description, update it in both files.

## Formatting tables

After editing any markdown table in this repo, use the
`code:autofix-markdown-tables` skill to keep columns properly padded and
aligned. It runs this repo's `md:fix-tables` task.

## Markdown linting

Every `.md` file is linted with `markdownlint-cli2` (config in
`.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`), and the `Markdown` workflow enforces it in CI.
After editing markdown, run:

```bash
task md:checkstyle   # lint only
task md:fixstyle     # align tables, then apply autofixable lint rules
```
